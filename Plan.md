# Game Logic
In the chain reaction game, an item will have some amount of threshold and when the threshold overflows, it exploders and pushes uniform value to all directions, the more items present and the more value it has, it will cause chain reaction. 

In the game, there will be a number of players, the goal of every player is to make the other player/s unable lose their chance to play. Losing all the pieces or losing the chance to put the pecies of a player will make them lose

# Game Structure
